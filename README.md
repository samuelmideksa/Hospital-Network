# Hospital Network
# Organization Network Configuration Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on the configuration of a network environment of an organization or office using Cisco Packet Tracer. The objective is to design and implement the functional network infrastructure of the organization.

## Organization Background

The organization selected for this project is MCM General Hospital, located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Founded by Myungsung Presbyterian Church of South Korea, MCM General Hospital aims to provide quality healthcare services to Ethiopians and train Ethiopian medical professionals. The hospital is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and collaborates with medical professionals from around the world to offer specialized medical care.

## Network Environment Formation

The networked environment at MCM General Hospital was formed to support the daily operations of the hospital and facilitate communication between various departments and medical professionals. The motive behind deploying a network was to improve efficiency, streamline processes, and enhance patient care. By implementing a network infrastructure, the hospital can securely store patient records, communicate with healthcare providers, and access medical resources efficiently.

## Network Components

### End Devices:
- PCs: Used by hospital staff for administrative tasks, patient record management, and communication.
- Laptops: Provide mobility for medical professionals to access patient information and medical resources.
- Smartphones: Used by staff for communication and accessing hospital systems.
- Tablets: Provide portable access to medical records and diagnostic tools.

### Connecting Devices:
- Switches: Used to connect multiple devices within each department and facilitate communication.
- Wireless Routers: Provide Wi-Fi connectivity for mobile devices and enable wireless communication within the hospital premises.
- Routers: Facilitate communication between different departments and ensure connectivity with external networks.

### Servers:
- FTP Server: Used for storing patient records and facilitating file transfers within the hospital network.
- SMTP Server: Facilitates email communication between hospital staff and external entities.
- HTTPS and DNS Server: Hosts internal applications and websites, providing secure access to medical resources and DNS resolution services.

## Communication Between Devices

Devices communicate with each other through the network infrastructure using various protocols and technologies. Switches facilitate communication within each department, while routers route data between departments and external networks. Wireless routers provide wireless connectivity, allowing mobile devices to connect to the network. Servers serve as central points for storing and accessing medical data and facilitating communication and collaboration among hospital staff.

## Network Topology

The network topology at MCM General Hospital is designed in a star topology, with a central IT department router connecting to routers serving different departments. This topology ensures centralized management and easy scalability. Additionally, wireless routers are deployed in medical and nursing departments and guest wing to provide Wi-Fi connectivity for mobile devices.

## Configuration in Cisco Packet Tracer

The network environment described above was configured in Cisco Packet Tracer, a network simulation tool. The configuration included setting up routers, switches, wireless routers, end devices, and servers, as well as configuring IP addressing, DHCP, DNS, wireless security settings, FTP, SMTP, HTTPS, and DNS servers.
